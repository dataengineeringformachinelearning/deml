## Projection boundary

Product dashboards stay on DEML. Sealed telemetry flows Angular → Django BFF →
FORJD with a tenant-bound `fjsvc_` token. FORJD materializes durable
`stream_results` projections; Django adapters return those shapes to Angular.

## Integration guide

See [docs/FORJD_INTEGRATION.md](https://github.com/dataengineeringformachinelearning/deml/blob/main/docs/FORJD_INTEGRATION.md).
