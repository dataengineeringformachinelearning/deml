## Execution boundary

Django remains the DEML control plane for identity, billing, consent, and product
APIs. High-frequency sealed processing runs in FORJD’s Rust engine
(`forjd-engine`) behind tenant-bound `fjsvc_` credentials.

## Integration guide

See [docs/FORJD_INTEGRATION.md](https://github.com/dataengineeringformachinelearning/deml/blob/main/docs/FORJD_INTEGRATION.md).
