## Operational health

Operators monitor sealed-path health through DEML’s public status surface and
FORJD `/ready`. Angular never calls FORJD with Firebase tokens; Django terminates
end-user auth and forwards with `fjsvc_`.

## Production checklist

See [docs/PRODUCTION_CHECKLIST.md](https://github.com/dataengineeringformachinelearning/deml/blob/main/docs/PRODUCTION_CHECKLIST.md).
