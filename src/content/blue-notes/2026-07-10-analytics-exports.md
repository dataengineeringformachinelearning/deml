## Export execution

Account-scoped export requests enter through Django and execute in FORJD.
Downloads use FORJD-backed export APIs adapted to Angular paths. DEML does not
run a local object-store export worker.

## Integration guide

See [docs/FORJD_INTEGRATION.md](https://github.com/dataengineeringformachinelearning/deml/blob/main/docs/FORJD_INTEGRATION.md).
