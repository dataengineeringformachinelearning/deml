## Deployment model

DEML ships distroless containers for the Django BFF and related control-plane
services. Production Angular runs on Vercel; Django runs on Fly. Sealed streaming
and processing stay on FORJD.

## Operations guides

See [docs/FLY.md](https://github.com/dataengineeringformachinelearning/deml/blob/main/docs/FLY.md) and [docs/VERCEL.md](https://github.com/dataengineeringformachinelearning/deml/blob/main/docs/VERCEL.md).
