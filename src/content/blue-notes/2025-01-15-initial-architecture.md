## Product control plane

DEML is the Firebase-authenticated user control plane and Angular product surface.
Django owns identity, billing, consent, learning content, and BFF adapters.

## Secure data plane

[FORJD](https://github.com/dataengineeringformachinelearning/forjd) is the
universal secure streaming engine: sealed ingest, projections, analytics, ML,
and replay/DLQ via tenant-bound `fjsvc_` tokens.

Production hosts: Angular on Vercel, Django on Fly, FORJD on Fly + Supabase.
Integration contract: [docs/FORJD_INTEGRATION.md](https://github.com/dataengineeringformachinelearning/deml/blob/main/docs/FORJD_INTEGRATION.md).
